This is my first react project!

In this project, I created a functional and interactive to-do list using React from scratch. 
The use of components, state, props, and more were covered to create this to-do list.

One of the best things about React is that it is relatively easy to create reusable components that can be used in multiple projects. 
Could take advantage of this by creating a to-do component that could be used to display each item on your list.

In addition to building the to-do list App, some key concepts were also covered such as conditional rendering and event handling. 
These are important in order to create dynamic and interactive apps with React.
